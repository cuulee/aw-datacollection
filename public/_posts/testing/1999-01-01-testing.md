### Server side
Testing server side is being done with **phpunit**.
There isn't a seamless way to integrate codeigniter and phpunit. To allow fully integration, two changes must be done to core. 
Check https://github.com/fmalk/codeigniter-phpunit for more.

The "TOAST - Unit Testing for CodeIgniter" was also tried but it isn't as powerful as phpunit. TOAST has a controller that only implements some methods that are available by default on phpunit. Also TOAST requires files (views, controllers) to be side by side with the application while phpunit can be separated.
